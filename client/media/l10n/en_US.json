To date there is no directive from the prefect to ban protests like Agile Grenoble conference. WTC Congress Center continues to host events every day. More than ever we wish we gather next Thursday around the values we share and which contribute to make our world better.",
            "paragraphe1": "We are passionate with informatics (techniques, tools, management, but also simply humans and their wellness at work) and we strive to constantly improve our practices, our behaviors and our mindset. In this world where everything is moving fast, we need key reference points for that, and thus we are looking for meaning and more human values at work, at home and in daily life.",
            "paragraphe2": "Let's imagine together a satisfied/satisfied business world where durable collaboration is the focus of attention. A business world where together, as a team, we develop know-how, interpersonal skills, and learning skills, while still taking better care of ourselves. For better economical, social and human outcomes.",
